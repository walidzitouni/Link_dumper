# Link Dumper - Web Crawler for Extracting Links and JavaScript Files
![Alt Text](screenshot.png)

## 📌 Overview
**Link Dumper** is a powerful Python-based web crawler designed for **pentesting and reconnaissance**. It scans websites for URLs and extracts **JavaScript (.js), text (.txt), JSON (.json), and XML (.xml)** files. This is useful for **subdomain enumeration, API key discovery, and security analysis**.

## 🚀 Features
- ✅ **Extracts URLs** from `<a>` and `<script>` tags  
- ✅ **Finds JavaScript files** that might contain sensitive data  
- ✅ **Crawls additional links** recursively for deeper analysis
- ✅ **Extracts API keys & version numbers from JavaScript files**
- ✅ **Saves results in JSON format** for further processing  
- ✅ **Handles relative and absolute links** automatically  
- ✅ **Multi-threaded crawling** for fast performance

## 🔥 Features in Detail

### **1️⃣ Crawling & Link Extraction**

- Parses **all `<a>` and `<script>` tags** on a given website.
- Extracts **internal & external URLs**.
- Saves extracted URLs in `file_links.json`.

### **2️⃣ JavaScript File Detection**

- Finds **all JavaScript files (`.js`)**.
- Useful for discovering **API endpoints, hidden parameters, and sensitive data**.
- Saves `.js` file URLs in `file_js.json`.

### **3️⃣ Recursive Crawling**

- Reads URLs from `file_links.json`.
- Recrawls found pages for **deeper enumeration**.
- Avoids duplicate links and saves unique results.

### **4️⃣ Multi-Threading**

- Uses `concurrent.futures` for parallel processing.
- Makes scanning large websites much faster.
